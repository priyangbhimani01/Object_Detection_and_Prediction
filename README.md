# Object Detection and Prediction

This project implements various object detection and prediction models using Python. It includes real-time object detection, image classification, and basic neural network implementations for computer vision tasks.

## Features

- Real-time object detection from webcam   
- Object prediction and classification on images  
- Basic neural network for image classification  
- Sample scripts demonstrating different approaches
